for three ticks a spike shadow appears, and on the fourth tick (80bpm) the spike itself appears. dont get hit, it's instakill!

modifiers appear every once in a while to make your run harder (public global booleans! Modifier.name)
spike shadows appear on the roof instead of the floor, but spikes still come from the floor
spikes are extra tall
spike shadows slowly drift
no jumping
spike shadows slowly fade away
spikes only take 3 ticks to appear
